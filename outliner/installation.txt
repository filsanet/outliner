JOE 1.8.7
Installation Notes

General
-------
1) When you first start up JOE, you may want to examine and set JOE's application preferences.
	Give the Edit:Application Preferences menu command. 
	The Application Preferences dialog appears. 
	Go through the preference panels, and set the items as desired.

Windows
-------
1) Ensure that your system has an appropriate Java 2 Runtime Environment (JRE) installed. 
	That means at least version 1.3. The latest 1.4 beta should also work, although we have not tested it.
	To determine what JRE, if any, is installed on your system:
		Give the Start:Settings:Control Panel menu command. 
		Run the Add/Remove Programs applet. 
		Look for entries in the list of installed software with Java in their names, such as Java 2 Runtime or Java 2 SDK.
	You can download JREs and Java 2 SDKs (which include JREs)as follows: 
		JRE 1.3.1_02:
			http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/jre/download-windows.html
		Java 2 SDK 1.3.1_02:
			http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/download-windows.html

2) If you've got more than one JRE or Java 2 SDK installed, edit the Outliner directory's run.bat file to invoke the correct version of Java.
	Determine the pathname for the java runtime .exe file you want to run.
		One way to do this: give the following command from the root directory of the drive you are examining in an MS-DOS command line window:
			dir java.exe /s
	There's a line near the end of run.bat that invokes the Java runtime. It looks like this:
		java -cp %CP% -Xincgc com.organic.maynard.outliner.Outliner en
	Edit that line so that it uses the pathname determined above.
		Example:
			C:\Program Files\JavaSoft\JRE\1.3.1_02\bin\java -cp %CP% -Xincgc com.organic.maynard.outliner.Outliner en

3) Execute the Outliner directory's run.bat file to start JOE. 
	Run.bat opens in an MS-DOS window whose environment space is set to a default value of 256 bytes. 
	On non-trivial Windows systems, that will not be enough environment space for running JOE.
	The fix: create a pif file, RUN.pif, that executes run.bat with 2k of environment space:
		[1] Right-click run.bat. 
		[2] A popup menu appears. 
		[3] Click the Properties menu item. 
		[4] A window titled "run.bat Properties" appears. 
		[5] Select the Memory tab. 
		[6] Set Initial Environment -- AKA environment space -- to 2048. 
		[7] Click the OK button.
		[8] Windows creates the file RUN.pif in the Outliner directory

4) If you want to setup Windows "sendto" then use the sendto.bat file. 
	In sendto.bat, change the path for cd to the directory you installed JOE into.


UNIX/Linux/Solaris:
-------------------

1) Edit run_joe.sh so that INSTALL_DIR points to the directory you installed JOE into.
	Make sure to make it executable and put it somewhere in your PATH. 
	
	Note: something like this
	
	   run_joe ../../file.opml 
	
	won't work. Because it needs to change in to the JOE directory to run it, the script 
	cuts off any path info, and then adds on the current directory, so it always passes $CWD/filename.opml to JOE.
