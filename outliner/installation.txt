A couple of notes about installation.

General

1) When you first start up JOE, you may want to examine and set JOE's application preferences
   To do so, give the Edit:Application Preferences menu command. The Application Preferences
   dialog appears. Go through the preference panels, and set the items as desired.


Windows Installation:

1) You should be running an appropriate Java 2 Runtime Environment (JRE). 
   That means at least version 1.3. The latest 1.4 beta should be OK too.
   
   To determine what JRE, if any, is installed on your system:
    Give the Start:Settings:Control Panel menu command. Then run the
    Add/Remove Programs applet. Look for entries for Java 2 Runtime andor Java 2 SDK.
     
...You can download JREs and Java 2 SDKs (which include JREs) as follows: 
    Java 2 SDK 1.3.1_02: http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/download-windows.html		
    JRE 1.3.1_02: http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/jre/download-windows.html

2) If you've got more than one JRE or Java 2 SDK installed, you may need to 
   edit the Outliner directory's run.bat file to call the correct version of Java. 
   
   The Java invocation line of run.bat should look something like this:
     c:\jdk1.3\bin\java -cp %CP% -Xincgc com.organic.maynard.outliner.Outliner

3) On the Windows platform, execute the Outliner directory's run.bat file to get JOE going. 

   Run.bat opens in an MS-DOS window whose environment space is set to a 
   default value of 256 bytes. 

   On non-trivial Windows systems, that may not be enough. Without enough 
   environment space, JOE won't run, because the SET statements in run.bat 
   will fail.  

   The fix: set run.bat so that it has lots of environment space: 

    [1] Right-click run.bat. 
    [2] A popup menu appears. 
    [3] Click the Properties menu item. 
    [4] A window titled "run.bat Properties" appears. 
    [5] Select the Memory tab. 
    [6] Set Initial Environment -- AKA environment space -- to 2048. 

3) If you want to setup Windows "sendto" then use the sendto.bat file. In
   the batch file you need to change the path for cd to the directory you
   installed JOE into.


UNIX Installation:

1) Edit run_joe.sh so that INSTALL_DIR points to the directory you installed JOE into.
   Make sure to make it executable and put it somewhere in your PATH. 

   One thing to note is, things like 

   run_joe ../../file.opml 

   won't work. because it needs to change in to the JOE directory to run it, the script 
   cuts off any path info, and then adds on the current directory, so it always passes 
   $CWD/filename.opml to JOE.
