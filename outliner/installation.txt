A couple notes about installation.

1) You should be running Java 1.3. I think the 1.4 beta should be OK too. If
   you've got more than one JDK installed, you may need to edit the run.bat
   file to call the correct version of java. This would look something like:
   c:\jdk1.3\bin\java -cp %CP% -Xincgc com.organic.maynard.outliner.Outliner

2) User specific preferences are stored under your home directory. Becuase of
   this, you should copy the macros found in prefs/macros/* to your 
   home directory, otherwise they won't be available to you. The directory
   YOu should copy them to is: %home%\outliner\macros\*.
