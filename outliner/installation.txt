Installation for JOE 1.8.10.4

If you have any trouble getting JOE running please post
your questions to the JOE help forums:
  http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=45897

Windows:

1) Make sure you've got a Java Runtime Environment. You should be 
   running version 1.4.0 or later. JOE version 1.8.9.2 was the last
   version that runs under 1.2.2, 1.3.0 or 1.3.1 with varying degrees
   of compatibility.

2) (optional) If you haven't already, download and decompress JOE. You 
   can obtain JOE from http://outliner.sourceforge.net/

3) (optional) If you've got more than one JRE installed you may need to
   explicitly set the path to java.exe/javaw.exe in JOE's run.bat file.
   To do this, edit the line that looks like this:
     java -cp %CP% -Xincgc com.organic.maynard.outliner.Outliner "%1"
   and change it to something like:
     c:\jdk1.4.1_01\bin\java -cp %CP% -Xincgc com.organic.maynard.outliner.Outliner "%1"

4) (optional) If you want to run JOE using a language other than English
   you will need to uncomment one of the java lines with a language
   specified, and comment out the java line with no language. For example,
   to run with Japanese it would look something like this:
     java -cp %CP% -Duser.language=ja -Duser.region=JP -Xincgc com.organic.maynard.outliner.Outliner
     :: java -cp %CP% -Duser.language=de -Duser.region=DE -Xincgc com.organic.maynard.outliner.Outliner
     :: java -cp %CP% -Duser.language=es -Duser.region=ES -Xincgc com.organic.maynard.outliner.Outliner
     :: java -cp %CP% -Xincgc com.organic.maynard.outliner.Outliner "%1"

5) Run JOE by double-clicking on the run.bat file or executing it from
   a command prompt. The first time you run JOE several files will
   be copied to your user directory into a subdirectory named "outliner".
   
   Note: If you are upgrading from a previous version of JOE you may need to 
   delete the "outliner" directory in your user directory if you experience problems.
   I recommend making a backup of this directory first since your custom preference
   settings, scripts, macros and find/replace patterns are stored here.


Unix/Linux/Solaris:

1) Follow steps 1 and 2 from the windows instructions above.

2) Edit run_joe.sh so that INSTALL_DIR points to the directory you installed JOE into.
   Make sure to make it executable and put it somewhere in your PATH. 
   
   Note: something like this:
     run_joe ../../file.opml 
   won't work. Because it needs to change in to the JOE directory to run it, the script 
   cuts off any path info, and then adds on the current directory, so it always 
   passes $CWD/filename.opml to JOE.
   
3) Steps 3,4 and 5 from the windows instructions above also apply but with edits 
   appropriate to the shell you're using.
