A couple notes about installation.

1) You should be running Java 1.3. I think the 1.4 beta should be OK too. If
   you've got more than one JDK installed, you may need to edit the run.bat
   file to call the correct version of java. This would look something like:
   c:\jdk1.3\bin\java -cp %CP% -Xincgc com.organic.maynard.outliner.Outliner

2) If you want to setup Windows "sendto" then use the sendto.bat file. In
   the batch file you need to change the path for cd to the directory you
   installed JOE into.
