Versions for the jars contained in the lib directory are noted below. 
I've begun removing version numbers from the jars so I won't need to
update the makefiles and run scripts with new jar names when we
upgrade the jars.

bsh.jar           1.2b7
jakarta-oro.jar   2.0.6
xmlrpc.jar        1.1 with minor modifications specific to JOE to the XmlRpcClient class.
xp.jar            0.5
jazzy-core.jar    0.4 with minor modifications.
